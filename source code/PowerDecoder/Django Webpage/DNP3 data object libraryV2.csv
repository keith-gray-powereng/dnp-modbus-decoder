0,211,Device Attributes,Identification of support for user-specific attributes,Attrib,This attribute is used to identify the support for private- vendor- or user-specific sets of attributes.  This object attribute consists of an ASCII string that lists all the attribute sets supported by the outstation. The list specifices 0-1- or more attribute sets.   Each element in the list consists of a namespace-index pair- where the namespace identifies the attribute set and the index specifies at which group 0 index the master can read attributes from that attribute set.  Namespaces are text names that uniquely in the world identify one attribute set from another. Namespaces shall be registered with the DNP Users Group- which is achieved by completing a form on their Web site.  The index part of the namespace-index pair specifies which group 0 index shall be used by the master to access attributes associated with the respective attribute set.  Before attempting to read user-specific attributes- the master shall read g0v211 at index 0.  Upon recieving the outstation's response- the master parses the list.  Using the information obtained after parsing- the master can unambiguously read or write- as appropiate- attributes associated with a specific attribute set.  ,Attribute data type code,UNIT8,Length,UNIT8,Identification of user-specific attribute sets,VSTRn,

An analog ouput event may be generated for a point only if the outstation returns an output status object for that point in response to a static (Class 0) request. An event may be generated by an oustation when it detects something of interest has occurred. Examples of this include a change in output point value or a change in output object flags.  An analog output event object may also be generated due to other application-depedent reasons.  This object shall not be generated to simply report that a command was received. Group 43 objects should be used for this purppose.
